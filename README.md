# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero.  The `myFunc` function attempts to divide `a` by `b`, but doesn't fully handle cases where `b` is zero. This leads to an error if the function is called with `b` equal to zero. The solution demonstrates a way to properly handle potential division by zero errors.
